# zoomviewsample

You can zoom camera preview, image and movie to the scale you set (say, *2.5) with original ratio by pinch on Android.

* ZoomCameraView extends TextureView
* ZoomImageView extends SurfaceView
* ZoomVideoView extends TextureView

## Tested

Galaxy S5, Nexus5, Nexus6, Nexus7 / Android 5.0.

## How to use

You will need to put movie.mp4 in internal storage on your device and an image.png ( .jpg / .gif ) in /app/src/main/res/drawable/ on your project by default, but you can use any name for them.
